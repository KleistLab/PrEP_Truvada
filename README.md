## Top-down
In the folder 'top_down' there are several scripts for different purposes:
* Simulation of clinical trial ... ... 
* PrEP efficacy estimation for each clinical study ... ...

## Bottom-up
The folder 'bottom_up' contains scripts and packages for the 'bottom-up' modelling 
in the paper. 
* There is a package  called 'Vectorized_clean' to compute the prophylactic efficacy 
in a vectorized way, i.e. this package can compute the PrEP efficacy trajectory of multiple 
regimens for multiple individuals in a single run. For detailed usage of this package you can 
check the examples in 'bottom_up/Vectorized_clean/example.ipynb'. 
* PrEP efficacy for different hypotheses ... ...
